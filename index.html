                My name is Patrick Lake, I’m currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp where I’m learning MERN full-stack web development. I’m aspiring to begin a career working as a web-developer. I currently live in Orlando FL, I’m married to my wife Victoria and I have a 1 year old girl named Selah. I’ve been a gigging musician for the past 5 years, playing acoustic guitar and singing cover songs at various bars and restaurants around the city of Orlando. I love to travel and I look forward to being able to do a lot more once I’m working as a web-developer. One of my bucket list items is to visit 100 countries and I’ve still got 94 to go.

                As I’ve been apart of the coding bootcamp, I’ve discovered that I love front end design. It’s been so much fun learning how to create and style websites, to take an idea and turn that into a virtual reality. I generally don’t enjoy tasks that are very subjective (I always disliked English class and writing in general), so I love that web design is very logic based while still letting me be creative.
